CREATE A FUNCTION THAT IS NAME GETCOMPUTERCHOICE
    CREATE A RANDOM NUMBER BETWEEN 0 AND 0.99
    
    IF RANDOM NUMBER IS HIGHER OR EQUAL TO 0 AND LOWER THAN 0.33 RETURNS VARIABLE ROCK
    IF RANDOM NUMBER IS HIGHER OR EQUAL TO 0.33 OR LOWER THAN 0.66 RETURNS VARIABLE PAPER
    IF RANDOM NUMBER IS ANYTHING ELSE, RETURNS VARIABLE SCISSORS


CREATE A FUNCTION THAT IS NAME IS GETHUMANCHOICE 
    CREATE A VARIABLE THAT SOTRES USER INPUT
    RETURN USER INPUT

CREATE A FUNCTION CALLED PLAYROUND WHICH TAKES AS AN ARGUMENTS HUMANCHOICE AND COMPUTERCHOICE
    CREATE VARIABLE THAT PUTS WHATEVER USER INPUTS IN HUMANCHOICE IN CAPITAL LETTERS
    IF COMPUTER CHOICE IS ROCK AND HUMAN CHOICE IS PAPER THEN HUMANSCORE INCREASES BY 1 AND SHOWS WHO WON AND WHY
    IF COMPUTER CHOICE IS PAPER AND HUMAN CHOICE IS SCISSORS THEN HUMANSCORE INCREASES BY 1 AND SHOWS WHO WON AND WHY
    IF COMUTER CHOICE IS SCISSORS AND HUMAN CHOICE IS ROCK THEN HUMANSCORE INCREASES BY 1 AND SHOWS WHO WON AND WHY
    IF COMPUTER CHOICE AND HUMAN CHOICE IS SAME THEN SHOWS TIE!
    EVERYTHING ELSE COMPUTERSCORE INCREASES BY 1 AND SHOWS WHO WON AND WHY


CREATE A FUNCTION CALLED PLAYGAME 
    IF THE SUM OF HUMANSCORE AND COMPUTERSCORE IS NOT 5, IT CALLS AGAIN TO PLAYGAME
    IF THE SUM OF HUMANSCORE AND COMPUTERSCORE IS 5
